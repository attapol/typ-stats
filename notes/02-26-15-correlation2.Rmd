# Agenda
* Last time
    + Positive correlation
    + Negative correlation
    + Scatterplot and linear trend line
* Today
    + Interpretation of correlation
    + Causation

# 50 shades of scatterplot

```{r,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(10)
x1 = rnorm(40)
y1 = rnorm(n=40,mean=-x1,sd=1)

x2 = rnorm(40)
y2 = rnorm(n=40,mean=-x2,sd=2)
par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(x1, y1)
plot(x2, y2)
```

y1 = rnorm(n=40,mean=-x1,sd=1)

x2 = rnorm(40)

# Negative Correlation : Interpretation

* $-1 < r < -0.7$ x and y are strongly negatively correlated
    + If x is high, then y is low. But there are not many exceptions.
* $-0.7 < r < -0.3$ x and y are weakly negatively correlated
    + If x is high, then y is low. But there are a lot of exceptions.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x4 = rnorm(40)
y4 = rnorm(n=40,mean=x4,sd=2)

x5 = rnorm(40)
y5 = rnorm(n=40,mean=x5,sd=1)

par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(x4, y4)
plot(x5, y5)
```

par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(x4, y4)

```{r}

# Positive Correlation : Interpretation

* $ 0.7 < r < 1$ x and y are strongly positively correlated
    + If x is high, then y is high. But there are not many exceptions.
* $ 0.3 < r < 0.7$ x and y are weakly positively correlated
    + If x is high, then y is high. But there are a lot of exceptions.

# 50 shades of scatterplot
```{r, echo=FALSE}
x3 = rnorm(40)
y3 = rnorm(40)

x6 = rnorm(40)
y6 = rnorm(40)
par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(x3, y3)
plot(x6, y6)
```

# 50 shades of scatterplot
```{r, echo=FALSE}
x3 = rnorm(40)
y3 = rnorm(40)


x6 = rnorm(40)
y6 = rnorm(40)
par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(x3, y3)
plot(x6, y6)
```
```{r}

# Lack of Correlation : Interpretation

* $ -0.3< r < 0.3$ x and y are not correlated. 
    + There is no relationship between x and y.
    
# Correlation does not always imply causation

![xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)

* It is a crime not to know this mantra. So let me say it again: correlation does not imply causation.

# Example
* Waiting duration and the number of people at the stop are negatively correlated.
* We cannot infer that the number of people CAUSES the waiting time to go down. 
* Correlation does not imply causation.

# Example
* High school GPA and college GPA are positively correlated.
* If we hack into the high school database and change our GPA to be very high, the college GPA wonâ€™t increase. 
* We cannot infer that the high school GPA causes the college GPA to go up or down
* Correlation does not imply causation.

# To be even more absurd, look at this correlation. 

![spurious correlation](http://www.tylervigen.com/correlation_project/correlation_images/us-spending-on-science-space-and-technology_suicides-by-hanging-strangulation-and-suffocation.png)

* We have the correlation, but we cannot infer that the US government has increased the spending on science to cause suicides. 
* Or we cannot infer that the US spending in science makes people suicidal. 

# Other correlation

* The number of donkeys in a state is negatively correlated with the number of PhD graduates.
* Foot sizes are positively correlated with brain sizes.
* High Fructose Corn Syrup consumption is correlated with body fat.
* Household income is correlated with SAT score.
