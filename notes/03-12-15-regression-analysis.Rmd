# Agenda
* Last time
    + Method of Least Square
    + Testing whether $\beta_1$ significantly contributes to the prediction of $y$
    + R-Squared
* Today
    + More on r-squared
    + Regression analysis steps
    + Limitation of this approach

# What is r-squared?
* Baseline model
  $$ y = \beta_0 + \epsilon $$
  $$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 $$
* Simple Linear Regression model
  $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x + \epsilon $$
  $$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x$$
* Definition of $r^2$
  $$ r^2 = \frac{SSE_{base model} - SSE_{model}}{SSE_{base model}}$$
  
# What does it tell us? (1)
* Definition of $r^2$
  $$ r^2 = \frac{SSE_{base model} - SSE_{model}}{SSE_{base model}}$$
* The percentage of SSE reduction from the base model if we use the regression model instead. 
    + If $SSE_{base model} = 30$ and $SSE_{model} = 20$, then 
    $$ r^2 = \frac{30 - 20}{30} = 1/3 \approx 0.33$$ 
    + The percentage of SSE reduction = $r^2 * 100 = 33.33\%$

# What does it tell us? (2)
* The percentage of SSE reduction from the base model if we use the regression model instead. 
* $r^2$ is the percentage of the variation explained by the model 

# Example from 10.66
The strength of concrete pipes over time
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(gdata)
```
```{r}
d = read.xls('http://www.typ-stats.com/xdatasets/PIPELOAD.XLS')
head(d)
```

# Example from 10.66
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
mymodel = lm(LOAD~AGE, data=d)
summary(mymodel)
```

    Residual standard error: 460.7 on 7 degrees of freedom
    Multiple R-squared:  0.7311,  Adjusted R-squared:  0.6927 
    F-statistic: 19.03 on 1 and 7 DF,  p-value: 0.003305
 
# What does it tell us? (2)
* 73.11 \% of the SSE is reduced by using the linear model.
* 73.11 \% of the variation in the data is explained by the age. 
    + This is a pretty good model. 
* What if it's much lower? like 30\% .

# Steps in regression analysis
* Determine $x$ and $y$
* Fit the linear regression model with `lm` command
* Draw a scatterplot with linear trend line
* Interpret the regression coefficients 
* Interpret $r^2$
* Determine whether $\beta_1$ is significant. Interpret the significance. 


# Limitation of regression analysis

# Limitation of regression analysis
* One outlier can really mess up your regression model. $\beta_0, \beta_1, r^2$ won't be accurate anymore.
```{r}
d = read.xls('http://www.typ-stats.com/xdatasets/PIPELOAD.XLS')
d[10,] = c(20000, 30) #<--- this will screw up the data
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mapping=aes(x=AGE,y=LOAD),data=d) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```
